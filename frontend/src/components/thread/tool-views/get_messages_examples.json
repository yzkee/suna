He also founded SoftGen.AI, building an AI‑driven web‑app builder that grew to $50 000 /month in recurring revenue and was sold for over $1 million before he turned 20, and he raised $4 million in funding to expand the platform. Kraemer has held senior product roles including Digital Product Developer at Brandwagon and co‑founded several startups such as Plutus GmbH, Golixxo, and MeineStadt.Digital, and he holds an O‑1 visa that enables him to split his time between San Francisco and Europe while scaling his AI ventures.",
