In elementary school, he was completely hooked on Minecraft, playing it every single day. In the process, he picked up knowledge of graphic design and programming.

Kraemer's entrepreneurial journey began unusually early. At just 12, he founded BluePage, building marketing landing pages for small businesses in Frankfurt, Germany. By 14, he had launched GastroPage, a restaurant digitization platform featuring QR-code menus, years ahead of the pandemic that would make such tools ubiquitous. Operating legally as a minor in Germany’s tightly regulated business environment required special court permission, an extraordinary exception granted to Marko. While still in high school, he went on to launch Plutus, a software development studio. “I essentially missed the last two years of school,” he recalls. “During COVID, [...] With a newly approved O-1 visa, Marko now splits his time between San Francisco and Europe as he scales Kortix’s broader vision: helping organizations transition from human to AI-driven knowledge work through both self-serve tools and enterprise-grade implementations. “We’re building for a future where AI agents can perform 70 to 80 percent of knowledge work,” he says. “This isn’t just automation. It’s a foundational shift unlike anything the labor market has seen before.” At just 20 years old, Marko's journey from teenage entrepreneur to AI visionary stands as a testament to his belief that innovation has no age limit, and that the future belongs to those who build it. [...] the last two years of school,” he recalls. “During COVID, a friend managed my Microsoft Teams login so I could focus on building the company. I only showed up for the exams.” After graduating in 2023, Marko founded Kortix with an ambitious mission to build the foundational infrastructure for the AI revolution. The first product, SoftGen, an AI-powered web app builder, scaled from zero to $50K in monthly recurring revenue within four months and was acquired by a private equity firm. His current focus is Kortix Suna, an open-source platform he describes as “WordPress for AI agents.” In just weeks after launch, Suna amassed 50,000 users, earned 14,000 GitHub stars, and sparked serious enterprise interest with over 200 enterprise bookings.

In elementary school, he was completely hooked on Minecraft, playing it every single day. In the process, he picked up knowledge of graphic design and programming.

Kraemer's entrepreneurial journey began unusually early. At just 12, he founded BluePage, building marketing landing pages for small businesses in Frankfurt, Germany. By 14, he had launched GastroPage, a restaurant digitization platform featuring QR-code menus, years ahead of the pandemic that would make such tools ubiquitous. Operating legally as a minor in Germany’s tightly regulated business environment required special court permission, an extraordinary exception granted to Marko. While still in high school, he went on to launch Plutus, a software development studio. “I essentially missed the last two years of school,” he recalls. “During COVID, [...] With a newly approved O-1 visa, Marko now splits his time between San Francisco and Europe as he scales Kortix’s broader vision: helping organizations transition from human to AI-driven knowledge work through both self-serve tools and enterprise-grade implementations. “We’re building for a future where AI agents can perform 70 to 80 percent of knowledge work,” he says. “This isn’t just automation. It’s a foundational shift unlike anything the labor market has seen before.” At just 20 years old, Marko's journey from teenage entrepreneur to AI visionary stands as a testament to his belief that innovation has no age limit, and that the future belongs to those who build it. [...] the last two years of school,” he recalls. “During COVID, a friend managed my Microsoft Teams login so I could focus on building the company. I only showed up for the exams.” After graduating in 2023, Marko founded Kortix with an ambitious mission to build the foundational infrastructure for the AI revolution. The first product, SoftGen, an AI-powered web app builder, scaled from zero to $50K in monthly recurring revenue within four months and was acquired by a private equity firm. His current focus is Kortix Suna, an open-source platform he describes as “WordPress for AI agents.” In just weeks after launch, Suna amassed 50,000 users, earned 14,000 GitHub stars, and sparked serious enterprise interest with over 200 enterprise bookings.

After introducing “Starters”, a set of focused tools that outperform traditional AI systems on presentations, data, and research tasks, Gagliardi turned to a more ambitious question. If AI can execute tasks, why can it not do them continuously, on schedule, and across different platforms without any manual prompting?\\n\\nThe answer materialized in a feature called “Workers”. In the landscape of consumer AI, it may be one of the most significant steps toward true personal automation.\\n\\n## From Single Tasks to an AI Workforce [...] ## Quick Reads\\n\\nMore\\n\\n### How Collective Intelligence Is Reshaping Crypto's Future: The Secret Behind BEEG Prediction Market Becoming Sui Ecosystem's Ultimate Compass in 2026\\n\\n### 2026 Passive Income Playbook: How BEEG Liquid Staking Doubles Your Sui Ecosystem Rewards\\n\\n### From Meme to GameFi Ruler: How BEEG is Rewriting Sui Chain Gaming Payment Standards In 2026\\n\\n### Why BEEG Has Become the \\\"Hard Currency\\\" of Sui's Social Protocol in 2026: Unveiling the Tipping Economy Revolution\\n\\n### XRP Price Prediction 2026: Why Seasoned Traders Choose MEXC to Position for XRP's Next Bull Run\\n\\n### Crypto Prices\\n\\nBitcoin\\n\\nBTC\\n\\n$95,710.20\\n\\n$95,710.20$95,710.20\\n\\n-1.10%Ethereum\\n\\nETH\\n\\n$3,313.90\\n\\n$3,313.90$3,313.90\\n\\n-0.53%$143.18\\n\\n$143.18$143.18XRP\\n\\n$2.0735\\n\\n$2.0735$2.0735Bitcoin Cash Node\\n\\n$599.9 [...] ## You May Also Like\\n\\n### Aizel Network Partners with ZENi to Drive Smarter Web3 Growth with Scalable Intelligence\\n\\nAizel Network is collaborating with ZENi to deliver scalable intelligence, smarter Web3 growth, along with AI-powered engagement for decentralized communities.\\n\\nShare\\n\\nBlockchainreporter\\n2025/09/19 00:50[### [Pastilan] End the confidential fund madness\\n\\nUPDATE RULES.
