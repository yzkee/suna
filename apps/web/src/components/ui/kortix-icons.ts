/**
 * Kortix brand icon layer.
 *
 * All icon imports in feature code should flow through this file instead of
 * importing from `lucide-react` directly. Benefits:
 *
 *   1. Single-line icon library swap (lucide → geist / tabler / iconoir / …)
 *   2. Stable Kortix-semantic names (`IconStatus` not `CircleDot`)
 *   3. Enforces a small curated set — pages can't drift into 40 random icons
 *
 * Rule for new pages: if the icon you want isn't exported here, add it here
 * and give it a purposeful name.
