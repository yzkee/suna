# ElevenLabs — Text-to-Speech, Voice Cloning & Sound Effects

ElevenLabs-powered audio generation. Convert any text to natural-sounding speech, clone voices, generate sound effects.

---

## Setup

**Required env var:** `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`

The CLI script at `scripts/tts.py` uses only Python stdlib (`urllib`, `json`, `argparse`) — no pip dependencies needed.

---

## Quick Reference

All commands use the CLI script:

```bash
python skills/KORTIX-tts/scripts/tts.py <command> [args]
```

### Speak — Convert text to speech

```bash
# Basic — default voice (George), multilingual v2 model
python scripts/tts.py speak "Hello, this is Kortix speaking."

# Named voice
python scripts/tts.py speak "Welcome to the presentation." --voice Rachel

# Custom output file
python scripts/tts.py speak "Chapter one." --voice George -o chapter1.mp3

# From a file (prefix with @)
python scripts/tts.py speak @article.txt -o narration.mp3

# From stdin
echo "Dynamic text" | python scripts/tts.py speak -

# With voice tuning
python scripts/tts.py speak "Dramatic reading." --voice Rachel --stability 0.3 --similarity 0.9 --style 0.7

# High quality output
python scripts/tts.py speak "Studio quality." --format mp3_44100_192

# Different model (faster, English-only)
python scripts/tts.py speak "Quick response." --model eleven_turbo_v2_5

# Speed control
python scripts/tts.py speak "Slowly now." --speed 0.7
python scripts/tts.py speak "Fast paced!" --speed 1.5
```

### Voices — List and search

```bash
# List all available voices
python scripts/tts.py voices

# Search by name, gender, accent, or use case
python scripts/tts.py voices --search "female"
python scripts/tts.py voices --search "british"
python scripts/tts.py voices --search "narration"
```

### Models — List available TTS models

```bash
python scripts/tts.py models
```

### Clone — Create a custom voice from audio samples

```bash
# Clone from audio files (1-25 samples, each 1-10 minutes)
python scripts/tts.py clone "ClientVoice" sample1.mp3 sample2.mp3

# With description
python scripts/tts.py clone "CEO" ceo_speech.mp3 --description "Confident male voice, American accent"

# Use the cloned voice
python scripts/tts.py speak "Hello from my cloned voice." --voice-id <returned_voice_id>
```

### Batch — Convert entire documents

```bash
# Convert a text file to a single audio file
python scripts/tts.py batch article.txt -o article_audio/

# Split by paragraphs — one audio file per paragraph
python scripts/tts.py batch book_chapter.txt --split-paragraphs -o chapter_audio/

# With specific voice
python scripts/tts.py batch script.txt --voice Rachel --split-paragraphs
```

### Sound Effects — Generate from text prompts

```bash
# Generate a sound effect
python scripts/tts.py sound "ocean waves crashing on a beach"

# With specific output and duration
python scripts/tts.py sound "thunderstorm with heavy rain" -o thunder.mp3 --duration 10.0
```

## Voice Settings Guide

Fine-tune voice output with these parameters:

| Parameter | Range | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--stability` | 0.0 - 1.0 | 0.5 | Higher = more consistent, lower = more expressive/varied |
| `--similarity` | 0.0 - 1.0 | 0.75 | Higher = closer to original voice, lower = more creative |
| `--style` | 0.0 - 1.0 | 0.0 | Higher = more expressive style, can reduce stability |
| `--speed` | 0.5 - 2.0 | 1.0 | Playback speed multiplier |

**Recommended presets:**

- **Narration/Audiobook:** `--stability 0.5 --similarity 0.75` (balanced, natural)
- **News/Formal:** `--stability 0.8 --similarity 0.8` (consistent, clear)
- **Character/Dramatic:** `--stability 0.3 --similarity 0.8 --style 0.7` (expressive, varied)
- **Conversational:** `--stability 0.4 --similarity 0.6` (natural variation)

## Output Formats

| Format | Quality | Size | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mp3_44100_128` | High (default) | Medium | General purpose, good quality |
| `mp3_44100_192` | Very high | Large | Studio quality, archival |
| `mp3_22050_32` | Low | Small | Voice messages, previews |
| `pcm_44100` | Lossless | Very large | Post-processing, editing |
| `pcm_16000` | Lossless low | Large | Speech recognition input |
| `opus_48000_128` | High | Small | Web streaming, efficient |

---

## Models

| Model | Speed | Quality | Languages | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `eleven_multilingual_v2` | Normal | Highest | 29 languages | Default — best quality, multilingual |
| `eleven_turbo_v2_5` | Fast | High | 32 languages | Low-latency, near-instant generation |
| `eleven_monolingual_v1` | Normal | Good | English only | Legacy English-only workloads |

Always use `eleven_multilingual_v2` unless speed is critical (then use `eleven_turbo_v2_5`).

## Common Workflows

### Narrate a document

```bash
# Read the document, generate speech
python scripts/tts.py speak @workspace/report.md --voice Rachel -o report_narration.mp3
```

### Create a podcast intro

```bash
python scripts/tts.py speak "Welcome to the Kortix Weekly. I'm your host, and today we're diving into autonomous AI agents." \
  --voice George --stability 0.4 --similarity 0.8 --style 0.5 \
  -o podcast_intro.mp3
```

### Narrate a presentation (per-slide)

For each slide, generate a separate audio file:
```bash
python scripts/tts.py speak "Slide 1: Introduction to our company" --voice Rachel -o slides/01.mp3
python scripts/tts.py speak "Slide 2: Our key metrics this quarter" --voice Rachel -o slides/02.mp3
```

Or write all narration to a text file (one paragraph per slide) and batch it:
```bash
python scripts/tts.py batch slide_notes.txt --split-paragraphs --voice Rachel -o slide_audio/
```

### Voice clone for personalization

```bash
# Clone the user's voice from samples they provide
python scripts/tts.py clone "UserVoice" sample1.mp3 sample2.mp3 sample3.mp3 \
  --description "The user's natural speaking voice"

# Use it for all future TTS
python scripts/tts.py speak "Personalized message." --voice-id <voice_id> -o message.mp3
```

### Generate ambient audio

```bash
python scripts/tts.py sound "coffee shop ambiance with gentle chatter" -o ambient.mp3 --duration 15
python scripts/tts.py sound "gentle rain on a window" -o rain.mp3 --duration 30
```

---

## Integration Notes

- **No pip dependencies.** The script uses only Python stdlib (`urllib.request`, `json`, `argparse`). Works on any Python 3.10+ installation.
- **Output files** are saved relative to the current working directory. Use `-o` to specify exact paths.
- **Long text** is handled automatically by the API. For very long documents (>5000 chars), consider using `batch` with `--split-paragraphs` for better quality and to avoid timeouts.
- **Rate limits** apply per your ElevenLabs plan. The script will return API errors if limits are hit.
- **Character usage** counts against your ElevenLabs monthly quota. Check your plan's limits.
