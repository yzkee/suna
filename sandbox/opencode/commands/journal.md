# Write Session Summary

Write a summary of this session to both the daily log and a session journal entry.

## Steps

1. Review what happened this session: tasks completed, decisions made, things learned, user feedback, unfinished work.

2. **Write to today's daily log** — append to `workspace/.kortix/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (use today's actual date):

```markdown
## HH:MM — Session Summary

**What happened:** [2-3 sentence overview]
- [Key task/decision 1]
- [Key task/decision 2]
- [Lessons learned]
- **Open items:** [Unfinished work]
```

3. **Write a full journal entry** — append to `workspace/.kortix/journal/sessions.md` (most recent first):

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Session Summary

**What happened:** [2-3 sentence overview]
**Completed:** [List of tasks done]
**Decisions:** [Key decisions with rationale]
**Learned:** [What was learned — patterns, corrections, discoveries]
**Open items:** [Unfinished work, handoff notes]
```

4. **Update MEMORY.md Scratchpad** — clear completed items, leave pending items for next session. Add handoff notes if needed.

5. If anything from this session reveals lasting knowledge (user preferences, project conventions, architectural decisions), write it to the appropriate `memory/` topic file.

6. Confirm to the user what was captured.
